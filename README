To install Arch Linux from another distribution, a root server rescue system or 
a live system, follow these instructions:

* Make sure your system is running Linux 2.6.32 or later.
* Extract this tarball. If you have enough memory, you can extract it into a 
  tmpfs file system. In the example below, we'll assume that it will be 
  extracted to /tmp/root.x86_64/.
* Create your partitions and mount them under /tmp/root.x86_64/mnt/.
* If you have bash 4 or later installed, run
   # /tmp/root.x86_64/bin/arch-chroot /tmp/root.x86_64/
  If you don't have bash 4, run the following commands:
   # cp /etc/resolv.conf /tmp/root.x86_64/etc
   # mount --rbind /proc /tmp/root.x86_64/proc
   # mount --rbind /sys /tmp/root.x86_64/sys
   # mount --rbind /dev /tmp/root.x86_64/dev
   # mount --rbind /run /tmp/root.x86_64/run
     (assuming /run exists on your system)
   # chroot /tmp/root.x86_64/
* In the chroot, run
   # pacman-key --init
   # pacman-key --populate archlinux
* Follow the Arch Linux installation guide
